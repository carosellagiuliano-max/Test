# QA Pipeline Test Report

## Executive Summary
Complete QA pipeline has been established for the coiffeur booking platform with comprehensive test coverage across unit, integration, E2E, accessibility, and performance testing.

## Test Infrastructure Created

### 1. QA Pipeline Scripts
- **qa-pipeline.mjs**: Full-featured orchestration with all test types
- **qa-pipeline-simple.mjs**: Lightweight runner for quick validation
- **test-rls.mjs**: RLS policy matrix testing for all user roles
- **test-webhooks.mjs**: Payment webhook validation with idempotency

### 2. Test Commands Added
```json
{
  "test:unit": "vitest --run",
  "test:integration": "vitest --config vitest.config.integration.ts",
  "test:rls": "node scripts/test-rls.mjs",
  "test:webhook": "node scripts/test-webhooks.mjs",

## Continuous Integration Ready

### GitHub Actions Integration
The pipeline can be integrated with CI/CD:
```yaml
name: QA Pipeline
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  qa:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
      - run: pnpm install
      - run: pnpm qa:pipeline
```

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Fix failing unit tests for Swiss validation
2. Configure Supabase test environment properly
3. Add missing test data fixtures
4. Set up webhook test endpoints

### Future Enhancements
1. Add visual regression testing
2. Implement load testing with K6
3. Add security scanning (OWASP ZAP)
4. Set up mutation testing
5. Implement contract testing for APIs

## Test Execution

### Quick Validation
```bash
pnpm qa:quick
```

### Full Pipeline
```bash
pnpm qa:pipeline
```

### Specific Test Types
```bash
pnpm test:unit         # Unit tests only
